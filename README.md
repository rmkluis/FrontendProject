Gif/Joker text app

//KEY FEATURES
Click a button and witness a joke appear on screen, followed by a .gif that appears in the format of a text message conversation.

//QUICK FACTS
- meets project requirements
- uses JokeAPI and Giphy API
- uses Anime.js 

//Frustrations while building
Not having a strong grasp of some HTML basics slowed me down a bit.
Anime.js was a little difficult, but seems straight forward. I plan to learn more.
Not having a clear picture of what I wanted the project to look like wasted a lot of time.
I am still not sure how to integrate libraries without CDN.
